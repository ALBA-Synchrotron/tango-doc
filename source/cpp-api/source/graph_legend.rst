Graph Legend

This page explains how to interpret the graphs that are generated by
doxygen.

Consider the following example:

1 /\*! Invisible class because of truncation \*/

2 class Invisible { };

3 

4 /\*! Truncated class, inheritance relation is hidden \*/

5 class Truncated : public Invisible { };

6 

7 /\* Class not documented with doxygen comments \*/

8 class Undocumented { };

9 

10 /\*! Class that is inherited using public inheritance \*/

11 class PublicBase : public Truncated { };

12 

13 /\*! A template class \*/

14 template<class T> class Templ { };

15 

16 /\*! Class that is inherited using protected inheritance \*/

17 class ProtectedBase { };

18 

19 /\*! Class that is inherited using private inheritance \*/

20 class PrivateBase { };

21 

22 /\*! Class that is used by the Inherited class \*/

23 class Used { };

24 

25 /\*! Super class that inherits a number of other classes \*/

26 class Inherited : public PublicBase,

27  protected ProtectedBase,

28  private PrivateBase,

29  public Undocumented,

30  public Templ<int>

31 {

32  private:

33  Used \*m\_usedClass;

34 };

This will result in the following graph:

|image1|

The boxes in the above graph have the following meaning:

-  A filled gray box represents the struct or class for which the graph
   is generated.
-  A box with a black border denotes a documented struct or class.
-  A box with a grey border denotes an undocumented struct or class.
-  A box with a red border denotes a documented struct or class forwhich
   not all inheritance/containment relations are shown. A graph is
   truncated if it does not fit within the specified boundaries.

The arrows have the following meaning:

-  A dark blue arrow is used to visualize a public inheritance relation
   between two classes.
-  A dark green arrow is used for protected inheritance.
-  A dark red arrow is used for private inheritance.
-  A purple dashed arrow is used if a class is contained or used by
   another class. The arrow is labeled with the variable(s) through
   which the pointed class or struct is accessible.
-  A yellow dashed arrow denotes a relation between a template instance
   and the template class it was instantiated from. The arrow is labeled
   with the template parameters of the instance.
