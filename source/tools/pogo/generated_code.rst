Generated Code
--------------

| 
| **The main differences with Pogo-6 code are:**

-  The source code will not be read when you re-open your project.
   Only the ***`.xmi <Warnings.html>`__*** will be re-loaded.
-  Your own code must be added only between specific tags:
   On following example, only the grey part will not be overwritten at
   next code generation.

|  **C++ Generated files :**

-  A method called **add\_dynamic\_attributes()** has been added to the
   MyObject.cpp.
   It will be called at startup to create dynamic attributes if any.
   It is NOT generated if the class is abstract !
