Inheritance Management
----------------------

Inheritance is not simply used as template.
That means that :file:`*.h` and :file:`*.cpp` files of inherited class must be in :file:`Makefile`.

Inheritance could be done from a class containing code and not only from pure abstract class.

An inheritance diagram is displayed onright side and all classes in this diagram are edited.

A color code display if items are abstract or concrete.
