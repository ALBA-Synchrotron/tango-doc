Description
-----------

This tool is the new Tango class generator.

It replaces the Pogo-6.xx code genarator.

It is based on `EMF <http://www.eclipse.org/>`_ (Eclipse Model Framework)
associated with openArchitectureWare (Xtext/Xtend) parsing/generating technology.

-  **Requirement :** This tool needs :program:`java-1.6` to be able to run.
-  It generates **C++** Tango class and **html** documentation pages.

   -  If you use :program:`Pogo-8.1.0` or above: **Java** and **Python** Tango
      class can be loaded and generated.
   -  If you use :program:`Pogo-7.x.x` or :program:`Pogo-8.0.x`: If you read **Java**
      or **Python** Tango class, Pogo-6 will be launched.

Main differences with Pogo-6
----------------------------

-  The class model is now saved in a :ref:`.xmi file. <warnings>`
-  The areas for programmer's code are well defined.
-  A method has been added to add dynamic attributes
   (add\_dynamic\_attributes())
-  The read attribute pointer allocation can be generated by Pogo.
-  Inheritance is now a real inheritance:

   -  :doc:`Inheritance <inheritance>` is not simply used as
      template.
   -  Inheritance could be done from a class containing code and not
      only from pure abstract class.
   -  An inheritance diagram is displayed on right side.
   -  All classes in this diagram are edited (that means that all
      classes are compatible with the Pogo version used) .
