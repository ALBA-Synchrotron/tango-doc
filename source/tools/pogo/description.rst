Pogo Description
( Tango class generator based on openArchitectureWare )
-------------------------------------------------------

| 

Description :
-------------

-  **Requirement :** This tool needs java 1.6 to be able to run.
-  It generates **C++** Tango class and **html** documentation pages.

   -  If you use **Pogo-8.1.0** or above: **Java** and **Python** Tango
      class can be loaded and generated.
   -  If you use **Pogo-7.x.x** or **Pogo-8.0.x**: If you read **Java**
      or **Python** Tango class, Pogo-6 will be launched.

| 

Main differences with Pogo-6 :
------------------------------

-  The class model is now saved in a `.xmi file. <Warnings.html>`__
-  The areas for programmer's code are well defined.
-  A method has been added to add dynamic attributes
   (add\_dynamic\_attributes())
-  The read attribute pointer allocation can be generated by Pogo.
-  Inheritance is now a real inheritance:

   -  `Inheritance <Inheritance.html>`__\ is not simply used as
      template.
   -  Inheritance could be done from a class containing code and not
      only from pure abstract class.
   -  An inheritance diagram is displayed on right side.
   -  All classes in this diagram are edited (that means that all
      classes are compatible with the Pogo version used) .
